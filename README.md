# My Obsidian Vault

This repository contains all the notes I'm working on and taking down using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app. Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on local Markdown files, allowing for personal knowledge management and note-taking with a rich set of features.

## Repository Structure

The notes are organized into several folders based on different categories and workflows:

| Folder           | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `00 - Inbox`     | This folder is for quick capture of notes and ideas that need to be processed later. |
| `01 - Projects`  | Contains notes related to ongoing projects, tasks, and goals.                        |
| `02 - Areas`     | Notes related to different areas of responsibility or interest.                      |
| `03 - Resources` | A collection of reference materials, articles, and knowledge-based resources.        |
| `04 - Daily`     | Daily notes, journals, or logs. Includes subfolders for each year and month.         |
| `05 - Archives`  | Archived notes that are no longer active but kept for reference.                     |
|                  |                                                                                      |
