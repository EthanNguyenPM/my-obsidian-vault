# What is a Zettelkasten for?

## A Zettelkasten helps your produce writing

- Zettelkasten helps you retrieve knowledge when your memory fails you - so you can turn that into writing.
- Help you decide what to read next and develop your ideas

## Underlying purposes

- **Retain what you read**: The Zettelkasten method helps break reading down into a series of engaging rituals that repeatedly expose you to the most interesting things you've read - thus helping you retain what you read.
- **Retrieve it quickly**: No more fumbling through pages to try to find that passage you want to reference. 	
- **Know what to read next**: If you're looking for something to read, you can look in your Zettelkasten to see what sparks your interest.
- **Develop your ideas**: Instead of starting each writing project with a blank page, you already have written short passages you can stitch together to create an instant first draft.
- **Have ideas**: Because your Zettelkasten frees your mental energy from having to rememeber and retrieve things you read or wrote long ago, you have more energy available to think about new ideas.
