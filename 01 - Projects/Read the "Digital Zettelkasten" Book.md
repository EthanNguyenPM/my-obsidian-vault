# What is a Zettelkasten

- Zettelkasten is German for *slip box*.
- In analog form, a Zettelkasten is literally a box filled with slips of paper, each slip with a not on it, as well as metadata used to organize those notes.
- Zettelkasten method is a way of organizing paper in a non-hierarchical way.
- Notes are organized so that you can arrive at one individual note through various routes, and that note can lead you to various other notes.
- The purpose of a Zettelkasten is not to find an individual note, but rather to explore the connections amongst notes.

# What is a Zettelkasten for?

## A Zettelkasten helps your produce writing

- Zettelkasten helps you retrieve knowledge when your memory fails you - so you can turn that into writing.
- Help you decide what to read next and develop your ideas

## Underlying purposes

- **Retain what you read**: The Zettelkasten method helps break reading down into a series of engaging rituals that repeatedly expose you to the most interesting things you've read - thus helping you retain what you read.
- **Retrieve it quickly**: No more fumbling through pages to try to find that passage you want to reference. 	
- **Know what to read next**: If you're looking for something to read, you can look in your Zettelkasten to see what sparks your interest.
- **Develop your ideas**: Instead of starting each writing project with a blank page, you already have written short passages you can stitch together to create an instant first draft.
- **Have ideas**: Because your Zettelkasten frees your mental energy from having to rememeber and retrieve things you read or wrote long ago, you have more energy available to think about new ideas.

### Note-taking does not take the pleasure away from reading

- **Main Idea**: Note-taking enhances the reading process instead of making it less enjoyable.
    
- **Key Points**:
    
    1. **Pleasure in Reading**: The author loves reading for the simple pleasure of moving eyes over well-written words.
    2. **Fear of Losing Enjoyment**: Initially, the author was concerned that note-taking might diminish the pleasure of reading.
    3. **Note-taking as a Complement**: Instead of making reading harder, note-taking can be easy and even pleasurable.
    4. **Zettelkasten System**:
        - Breaks down note-taking into various activities.
        - Helps extend the time spent on reading, writing, and thinking without causing fatigue.
    5. **Mental States**: Different activities involved in managing notes occur in various mental states (similar to the “Seven Mental States of Creative Work” from the author's previous work).
    6. **Balanced Reading**: Not all reading has to be for note-taking. The author still reads purely for pleasure at times.

### Note-taking is not mindlessly writing down everything you read

- **Main Idea**: Note-Taking, when done correctly, is not about mindlessly copying everything you read; instead, it is a selective and thoughtful process that enhances retention and understanding.

- **Key Points**:
	1. **Initial Misconception**: 
		- The author initially thought note-taking involved mindlessly writing down everything and found it pointless.
		- Concerns included ruining the reading experience and overcrowding the mind with other people’s ideas, leaving little room for personal thoughts.

	2. **Correct Approach to Note-taking**:
		- `Retention`: Even if copying word-for-word, note-taking aids in retention.
		- `Rewriting in Your Own Words`: The more effective method is to rewrite the ideas in your own words, making the process more powerful and personal.
		- `Selective Writing`: you don't write down everything you read, you write down important things
			- Things are `interesting`.
			- Things are `relevant` to your work.
			- Things that you want to `retain`.

### Note-taking is not boring

- **Main Idea**: While note-taking may seem boring or pointless at first glance, especially when re-writing in your own words, it is actually a fun and engaging process, offering just the right level of challenge.

- **Key Points**:
	1. **Initial Perception**: Re-writing or note-taking in your own words seem like it would be boring.
	2. **The Fun in Re-writing**:
		- Re-writing a passage in your own words is much easier than facing a blank page, but still challenging enough to keep you engaged.
		- This process helps train the brain for situations where you need to start from scratch, reducing the fear of blank page.
	3. **Other Fun Aspects of Note-taking**:
		- Activities like adding keywords or linking notes in systems like Zettelkasten provide different types of fun challenges.
		- These small challenges keep the process engaging without being overly difficult or monotonous.
	4. **Unexpected Benefits**:
		- The act of re-directing your attention to a passage and re-writing it can reveal new insights, despite the initial assumption that nothing new could emerge.

### Google is not a substitute for notes

- **Main Idea**:

- **Key Ideas**:
	1. **Initial Assumption**: 
		- The author used to believe that there was no need to keep personal knowledge database since all information is readily available online.
	2. **Limitations of Search Engine**:
		- While search engines are good for retrieving facts quickly, notes are more than just records of facts.
		- Notes, especially with systems like Zettelkasten, contain personal thoughts and connections that you won't find in a simple Google search.

	3.	**Example**: ***Historical Connection***:
		- Facts like James Lind's clinical trial on scurvy can be found online, but personal notes may connect that information with other relevant details, such as:
			- The British Navy's delay in adopting lemon juice, resulting in unnecessary deaths.
			- Skepticism faced by other medical pioneers like Ignaz Semmelwis, who advocated handwashing to prevent infections.
		- These connections are unlikely to be found on a Wikipedia page or internet search.
	4. **Memory and Creative Thinking**:
		- Depending on search engines for everything wastes working  memory. The brain power that could be used for creative thinking.
		- Notes help solidify memory through the process of managing and interacting with them, reducing the need to constantly "jog" your memory.
	5. **Notes as Tools for Developing Ideas**:	
		- Unlike the internet, which provides static information, your notes can store incomplete thoughts and evolving ideas.
		- Managing notes over time helps you make connections and develop new ideas that you wouldn't arrive at through a simple internet search.
