#### Wrapping Up

One of the loveliest elements of modern Python is its emphasis on looping over iterables, including those that are not concrete collections. In some mistakes in Chapter 4, Advanced Python Usage, we look at explicit “iterator algebra.” This chapter reflects patterns and habits you will use nearly every time you write Python code; we have emphasized Python’s focus on looping over the data you are actually concerned with rather than over indirections towards it.

Beyond those mistakes that guide you to emphasize the right things to loop over, we also looked at the danger of mutating concrete collections during iteration and at how while loops, when they are the more elegant approach, can benefit from use of the newish walrus operator.
