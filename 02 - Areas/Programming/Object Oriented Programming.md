## Encapsulation

The first of the three tenets of object-oriented programming is encapsulation. This word might conjure up an image of a space capsule, a cell wall, or a medical gelcap, where precious cargo is protected from the outside environment. In programming, encapsulation has a similar but even more detailed meaning: hiding internal detail of state or behavior from external code and having all code in one place.

### Encapsulation with Functions

Functions are prime example of encapsulation because when you call a function, you generally don't care how the function work internally.

Just like the built-in function `len()` in python, you don't need to know how many line two or two thousand lines were written inside, or maybe how many variables or none that the function used. Instead, you just care about what arguments to pass in and how to use the result that's returned. You no longer have to worry about the detail of the implementation.

However, if one day you find that there is a simpler or faster algorithm to calculate an average, you could rewrite the function in a new way.
