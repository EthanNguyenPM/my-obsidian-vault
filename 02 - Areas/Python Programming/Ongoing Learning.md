    - Study inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

2. **Learn Web Development with Flask/Django**
    - Build a simple blog application using Flask.
    - Understand how to use Django for larger, more complex projects.

3. **Explore Data Science with Pandas & NumPy**
    - Learn to manipulate datasets using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
    - Practice cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.

4. **Improve Problem-Solving Skills**
    - Solve Python problems on **LeetCode** and **HackerRank**.
    - Aim to solve at least 5 problems per week.

5. **Automate Daily Tasks with Python**
    - Write small automation scripts for file handling, emails, and web scraping.
    - Use libraries like **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**.

## Future Learning
