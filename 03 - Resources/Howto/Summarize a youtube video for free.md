## Overview

- While there are many tools and services available for summarizing YouTube videos, most require payment or a subscription.
- However, there's a way to get around these restrictions and use the summarization feature for free.
## Tips 

- Open any web browser, such as Firefox, Chrome, etc.
- Visit [NoteGpt](https://notegpt.io/youtube-video-summarizer), where you can use the summarizing tool for free.
- Keep in mind, though, that the tool only allows one free usage per session.
- To use it multiple times, simply restart your incognito/private browser session, and you'll be able to use it again for free.
