## Overview

Since Medium premium post won't allow users like us to watch it for free, we have another solution derived from an extension on Chrome. That's Freedium

## Solution

Whenever you read a premium post, for instance, a website like this [medium post](https://medium.com/djangotube/django-roles-groups-and-permissions-introduction-a54d1070544). You just need to add a prefix `https://freedium.cfd/` to the link:

```
https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/djangotube/django-roles-groups-and-permissions-introduction-a54d1070544
```
