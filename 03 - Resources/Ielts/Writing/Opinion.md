There is an ongoing debate about whether students should be equipped with a new language from primary school or from secondary school. Personally, I firmly support the former, as picking up a new language at an early age can significantly improve both cognitive development and future opportunities.

One major reason why foreign languages should be incorporated into the primary school curriculum is that children are highly receptive to language acquisition. At an early age, the brain is still developing and is capable of absorbing new sounds, vocabulary, and grammatical structures naturally and effortlessly. For example, in countries like the Netherlands and Finland, children begin learning a new language in kindergarten. As a result, most of them become fluent speakers by the time they reach their teenage years. Introducing new languages at an early stage not only enhances pronunciation and listening skills but also builds a strong foundation for future learning.

Another benefits of introducing foreign languages at the primary school is that it fosters a positive attitude towards cultures and ways of thinking. Young children are naturally curious and learning a new language can spark their interest in customs, lifestyles, and perspective around the world. For instance, a child who learns Japanese at an early age can become more open to Japanese culture, values and social norms. This cultural awareness not only broadens the worldview but also helps them become empathetic and tolerant individuals in an increasingly globalized society

In conclusion, learning a foreign language from an early age provides numerous advantages for children, from improving their cognitive abilities to fosters cultural awareness. Therefore, I strongly believe that foreign language should be included in the primary school curriculum to better prepare students for the globalized world
