The table presents data on the number of visitors to the UK between 2003 and 2008, along with their total spending, average expenditure per visit, and average number of nights spent during each visit.

Overall, the number of visitors and total spending generally increased over the six-year period, with a peak in both figures occurring in 2007 and 2008 respectively. While average spending per visit showed a gradual upward trend, the average number of nights per visit declined in the final two years.

In 2003, the UK welcomed approximately 24.7 million visitors, who collectively spent £11.86 billion. Both figures rose steadily year by year, reaching 32.7 million visitors in 2007 and £16.32 billion in spending in 2008. Although the number of visitors slightly decreased in 2008 to 31.88 million, it still remained higher than in any of the earlier years.

Average spending per visitor showed some fluctuations but increased overall, from £475 in 2003 to £511 in 2008. The highest jump occurred in the final year. Meanwhile, the average number of nights per visit remained stable at around 8.2–8.4 from 2003 to 2006, before declining to 7.7 in both 2007 and 2008.
