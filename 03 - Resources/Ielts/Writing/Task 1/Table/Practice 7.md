The table compares the proportion of electricity generated using four different types of fuel in five Asian countries in 2005.

Overall, nuclear energy was most widely used in Japan, while coal and lignite dominated electricity production in Malaysia. Thailand was the only country that did not utilize nuclear power, relying heavily on petroleum products and other sources. Hydro and wind energy were primarily used in South Korea, accounting for nearly half of its electricity generation.

In Malaysia, coal and lignite accounted for the majority of electricity production at 61%, followed by nuclear energy at 19%. In contrast, Japan relied most heavily on nuclear power, which made up 49% of its total generation, whereas coal and lignite contributed just 6%. Similarly, South Korea generated 33% of its electricity from nuclear sources, with hydro and wind energy playing a significant role at 48%, the highest proportion among all five countries.

Turning to the remaining countries, Singapore produced 42% of its electricity from coal and lignite, while 39% came from other sources. Nuclear energy contributed a modest 13%. Thailand, which did not use nuclear power at all, relied mainly on petroleum products (36%) and had the highest dependence on other sources at 42%.
