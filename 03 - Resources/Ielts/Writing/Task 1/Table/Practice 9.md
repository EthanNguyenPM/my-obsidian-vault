The table presents data on cocoa bean production, measured in tons, in six regions around the world between 1992 and 1998.

Overall, Africa consistently produced the largest quantity of cocoa beans over the period, while Oceania had the lowest output. South America experienced a steady decline in production, whereas other regions showed either slight fluctuations or minimal changes.

Africa recorded the highest figures across all four years, starting at 1,397,000 tons in 1992. Production rose gradually to reach a peak of 1,920,000 tons in 1996, before decreasing slightly to 1,822,000 tons in 1998. In contrast, South America saw a continuous drop in output, from 568,000 tons in 1992 to only 333,000 tons by 1998.

Asia’s cocoa production increased significantly between 1992 and 1994, rising from 416,000 to 498,000 tons. However, it then declined marginally, falling to 415,000 in 1996 and 414,000 in 1998. The Caribbean region remained relatively stable, with production staying around 68,000 to 69,000 tons in most years, except in 1992 when it was slightly lower at 52,000 tons. North Central America experienced minor fluctuations, starting and ending at 50,000 tons, despite a dip to 42,000 in 1994. Oceania, which had the lowest figures throughout the period, saw a gradual decrease in production, from 42,000 tons in 1992 to just 34,000 tons in 1998.
