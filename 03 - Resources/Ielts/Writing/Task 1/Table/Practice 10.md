The table illustrates the percentage of UK residents who expressed interest in six different sports—football, rugby, golf, cricket, judo, and swimming—based on surveys conducted in 1990, 2000, and 2010.

Overall, football remained the most popular sport across all three decades, although its popularity declined slightly over time. In contrast, interest in rugby rose significantly, while judo became less popular. Other sports saw only minor fluctuations in public interest.

In 1990, football attracted the highest percentage of interest, with 59% of respondents reporting it as a sport they liked. This figure dropped marginally to 57% in 2000 and further to 56% in 2010. Rugby, however, experienced a consistent rise in popularity, increasing from 12% in 1990 to 24% by 2010, effectively doubling over the two decades.
  

Golf maintained steady levels of interest, starting and remaining at 28% between 1990 and 2000, before falling slightly to 26% in 2010. Cricket showed a modest upward trend, maintaining a stable 12% in both 1990 and 2000 and rising to 14% in 2010. In contrast, judo saw a sharp decline in popularity, with its figure dropping from 9% in 1990 to only 4% in 2010. Swimming also experienced some variation, increasing from 15% to 18% in 2000, but then decreasing slightly to 16% in 2010
