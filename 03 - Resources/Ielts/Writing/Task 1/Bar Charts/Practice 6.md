The line graph illustrates the percentages of individuals visiting the cinema once a month or more across four age groups from 1984 to 2003.

Overall, the trends show fluctuating patterns in cinema attendance among different age groups over the 19-year period.

The 15-24 age group exhibited the highest percentages throughout the period, starting at around 40% in 1984, reaching a peak of approximately 58% in 1998, and then slightly declining to about 54% by 2003. On the other hand, the 7-14 age group began at a lower rate of around 10% in 1984, experienced a significant increase to about 30% by 1998, before dropping to approximately 24% in 2003.

In contrast, the 25-35 age group started at approximately 15% in 1984, saw a gradual rise to around 28% in 2000, and decreased slightly to about 22% by 2003. Lastly, the 35 and over age group had the lowest initial rate of around 5% in 1984, peaked at about 10% in 2000, and ended the period at approximately 8% in 2003.
