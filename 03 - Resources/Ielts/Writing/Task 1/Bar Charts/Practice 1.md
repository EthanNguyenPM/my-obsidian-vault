The bar chart illustrates the employment rate of man and woman in South Africa, Chile, Finland and Norway in 2002.

Overall, it is clear that the proportion of men in the workforce was higher than that of women in all four countries. Also, noticeable that the employment figures for the two sexes in Finland and Norway were relatively close, while there was more of a difference in South Africa and Chile. In the latter case, the gap between percentages of men and women was the largest.

Looking at the graph closely, one can see that nearly 80 percent of men in Norway were in work, which makes them the group with the highest rate of employment for the period. The proportions of Chilean and Finnish men were close behind at roughly 70 percent. However, the percentage of South Africa men in work was low compared to others since only half of them held jobs. 

As was the case with man, Norway had the highest employment rate for women, at above 70 percent. Finland was the second with around 65 percent of women in work. The rates for South Africa and Chile were lower; only one-third of women worked in both countries. Moreover, Chile's female employment was only half of what its male rate was.
