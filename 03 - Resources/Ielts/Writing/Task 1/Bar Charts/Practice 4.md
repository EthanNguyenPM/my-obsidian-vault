The bar chart illustrates the number of households in the United States, categorized by annual income, in three specific years 2007, 2011, and 2015.

Overall, the number of households earning $100,000 or more increased significantly over the period and became the most common income group by 2015. In contrast, middle-income brackets remained relatively stable, while the number of low-income households rose slightly before falling.

In 2007, approximately 25 million households earned less than $25,000. This figure rose to around 28 million in 2011, before a minor decline to 27 million in 2015. A similar trend was seen in the $25,000–$49,999 group, which increased from 27 to 30 million between 2007 and 2011, but fell back to 28 million by the end of the period.

The $50,000–$74,999 bracket remained relatively stable, with around 21 million households throughout. The number of households earning $75,000–$99,999 fluctuated slightly, falling to 18 million in 2011 before rising to 20 million in 2015. By contrast, high-income households—those earning $100,000 or more—increased steadily from 29 million in 2007 to 32 million in 2011 and peaked at 33 million in 2015, making this the largest income group.
