### Response

The diagram illustrates the process of making cheese, detailing the steps from curd formation to the final ripened product.

The process begins with the separation of curds from whey. The curds are then milled into smaller pieces before being salted. At this stage, fresh cheeses such as cottage and cream cheese can be made. However, to produce firmer cheese varieties, the curds undergo further processing.

Next, the salted curds are poured into molds, forming the desired shape. These molds are then subjected to pressing, which removes excess whey and compacts the cheese. Additional whey drainage occurs during this stage.

Following this, the molded cheese undergoes a ripening process. It is stored under controlled conditions for a certain period to develop its texture and flavor. Once fully ripened, the cheese is ready for distribution and consumption.

Overall, the cheese-making process involves multiple steps, including whey separation, milling, salting, molding, pressing, and ripening. Fresh cheeses are produced earlier in the process, while aged cheeses require additional steps and time to mature.
