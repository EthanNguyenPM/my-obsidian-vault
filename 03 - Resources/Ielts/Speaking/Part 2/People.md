>**ToTopic: Describe a person you admire
 You should say:
	•	Who the person is
	•	What they are like
	•	What they have done
	•	And explain why you admire them


> One person I truly admire is my mother. She’s not only the most important woman in my life but also the strongest and kindest person I’ve ever known.


> My mother is a humble, hard-working woman in her early 60s. She has a warm smile and a calm personality, but beneath that lies incredible strength and resilience. She’s always been the backbone of our family, both emotionally and financially.


> When I was a child, she used to work long hours under the scorching sun as a street vendor, just to make ends meet. I remember her leaving home at sunrise and coming back after sunset, exhausted but still smiling. Over the years, her skin became darker from the sun, and her hands rough from the work. But not once did she complain. All she wanted was to give her children a better life and proper education.

> What I admire most is her selflessness and her ability to stay strong no matter how hard things got. She’s truly a role model to me — someone I deeply respect and always look up to. Her sacrifices and unconditional love have shaped who I am today.
