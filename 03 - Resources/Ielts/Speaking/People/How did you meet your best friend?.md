I'd like to talk about my best friend, Tien Dat, who I met when we were a freshman in university. On the very first day of class, I chose to sit near the front because I wanted to fully focus on the lecture. There were just a couple of empty seats left, and by chance, he sat next to me. Although we had never met before, he started asking me all kinds of questions related to the lesson.

  

At first, I found it slightly irritating, but I still tried to be helpful. After class, we exchanged contacts, and over time we just clicked. Since then, weâ€™ve stuck together and become really close
