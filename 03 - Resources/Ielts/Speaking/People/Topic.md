**Do you like being around other people?**

> Well, it depends. I’m quite an introverted person, so I usually enjoy spending time alone, especially when I need to focus or relax.

**Do you prefer to spend time with friends or family?**

> That’s a tough question because I value both. But if I had to choose, I’d say I prefer spending time with my family. We have a strong bond, and I feel like I can truly be myself around them. Plus, family gatherings are always warm and fun. Of course, I also enjoy hanging out with my friends, especially when we play football or grab coffee together.

**Are you good at making new friends?

> To be honest, I’m not that good at making new friends because I’m quite shy at first. It takes me some time to open up to people. But once I feel comfortable, I can be very friendly and easy to talk to. I think trust is important in building any relationship.

> One clear example is that he used to work all day under the burning sun. His skin became darker because of it, just to earn enough money for us to go to school.

**Do you like spending time with older people?**

Absolutely. I enjoy spending quality time with older people, particularly my grandmother. They’ve lived through so much, so they often have valuable lessons and stories to share. For instance, my grandmother often gives me advice about relationships and how to deal with difficulties in life. Her stories always give me a new perspective

**What kinds of people do you like to be friends with?**

Honestly, I prefer making friends with people who are genuine and have a great sense of humor. That's because I can trust them easily, and they can know how to brighten up a bad day. My best friend, Tien Dat, is a perfect example. Whenever I'm under pressure. He knows exactly what to say or do to make me laugh. Thanks to friends like him, I can stay positive even during tough times

**Do you get along well with your neighbors?**

Absolutely, I have a great relationship with the people living next door. What I appreciate how approachable and supportive they are. I still remember, once, when a water pipe burst in my house, they didn't hesitate to come over and help me to fix it. So I'm really obliged to them 

**What qualities do you think a good leader should have?**	

There are several essential qualities that define a good leader, but I believe two of the most important are responsibility and the ability to listen. These traits help a leader to build trust within a team and ensure that everyone feels heard and valued. For instances, my former boss at the tech company always made sure to listen to every team member's opinion and didn't hesitate to take the blame when things went wrong. That made us respect him even more.

 **Have you ever helped a stranger?**

Absolutely, I always try to help people whenever I can, especially in the situation when they need assistance the most. In Vietnam, it's not uncommon to see other people stuck on the road with a broken-down motorbike. One time, I noticed a man struggling to push his motorbike on the rainy day, I stopped and helped him push all the way to the nearest repair shop. He was so thankful to me and I felt so good about it
