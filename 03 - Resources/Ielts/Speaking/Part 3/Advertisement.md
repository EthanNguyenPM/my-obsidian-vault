> **Why are some advertisements harmful for children?**

> Some advertisements can be harmful for children because they are easily influenced and may not be able to tell the difference between what’s real and what’s exaggerated. For example, ads for junk food often show kids having fun while eating unhealthy snacks, which can lead to poor eating habits. Also, some ads promote expensive toys or games, creating pressure on children and even their parents. In some cases, the content might be inappropriate or misleading, which can affect a child’s development and values.
