### What kind of song do you like to sing #card 

Honestly, im not much of a singer. I rarely sing in the public or even at home. That's because i feel very self-conscious about my voice. However, if i were to sing, i might hum along to some soft pop or acoustic tracks. i find their melodies easier to follow and less intimidating. Still, i generally prefer listening to music over singing it myself.

### Did you learn to sing when you were a child

Not really. Although I sang songs during music classes in elementary school, my teacher never actually taught us how to sing properly. However, I wish she had given us more structured training. If I had learned the basics of breathing and vocal technique back then, I might feel more confident singing now and have a deeper appreciation for music.

### Do people in your country like to sing? and why?

I believe Vietnamese people are very fond of singing. In fact, karaoke parlors are everywhere, and people of all ages love to gather and sing for fun. Moreover, these days, many individuals enroll in vocal training courses—even if they don’t aim to become professional singers—simply because they enjoy singing and want to improve their skills.
