**Becoming an Expert**

A Expertise is **commitment coupled with creativity**. Specifically, it is the **commitment of time, energy, and resources** to a relatively narrow field of study and the creative energy necessary to **generate new knowledge** in that field. It takes a **considerable amount of time** and **regular exposure to a large number of cases** to become an expert.

**A Expertise** is **commitment coupled with creativity**. Specifically, it is the **commitment** of time, energy, and resources to a relatively narrow field of study and the creative energy necessary to **generate new knowledge** in that field. It takes a considerable amount of time and regular exposure to a large number of cases to become an expert.

**B** An individual enters a field of study as a **novice**. The novice needs to learn the **guiding principles and rules** - the heuristics and constraints - of a given task in order to perform that task. Concurrently, the novice needs to be exposed to specific cases, or instances, that test the boundaries of such heuristics. Generally, a novice will find a **mentor** to guide her through the process of acquiring new knowledge. A fairly simple example would be someone learning to play chess. The novice chess player seeks a mentor to teach her the object of the game, the number of spaces, the names of the pieces, the function of each piece, how each piece is moved, and the necessary conditions for winning or losing the game.


"The **impact of technology** on **society** has been a subject of much debate. Some argue that technology has **improved our lives** by making communication easier and providing access to vast amounts of information. Others argue that technology has had a **negative effect**, leading to social isolation and a decline in critical thinking skills. However, it is clear that technology has become an **integral part of our lives**, and we must learn to use it **responsibly**."
