### 5. **Update Graphics Driver**

- An outdated graphics driver can slow down performance.

    - Go to **Options** > **Privacy & Security**.
    - Scroll to **Permissions** and check **Prevent accessibility services from accessing your browser**.

### 8. **Use Safe Mode**

- Running Firefox in Safe Mode can help identify whether add-ons are slowing it down.
    - Go to the menu > **Help** > **Restart with Add-ons Disabled**.
    - If performance improves, remove unnecessary add-ons.

### 9. **Tweaks in `about:config`**

- Advanced configuration changes can boost performance:
    - Set `browser.download.animateNotifications` to **False**.
    - Disable telemetry by setting telemetry-related preferences to **False**.

### 10. **Refresh Firefox**

- If Firefox is running slow, refreshing the browser can restore it to default settings.
    - Go to `about:support`.
    - Click on **Refresh Firefox** to restore default settings and remove all add-ons.
