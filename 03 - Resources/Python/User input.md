## How to assign variables with user input

While we output a variable’s value using print(), we assign information to a variable using input(). The input() function requires a prompt message, which it will print out for the user before they enter the new information. For example:

```python
likes_snakes = input("Do you like snakes? ")
```

In the example above, the following would occur:

1. The program would print "Do you like snakes? " for the user.
2. The user would enter an answer (e.g., "Yes! I have seven pythons as pets!") and press enter.
3. The variable likes_snakes would be assigned a value of the user’s answer.
