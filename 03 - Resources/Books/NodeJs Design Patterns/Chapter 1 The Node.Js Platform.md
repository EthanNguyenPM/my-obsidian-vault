## The NodeJs Philosophy

Every programming platform has a set of principles, shaped by its community, technology, and ecosystem, that guide its evolution and the development of applications. In Node.js, these principles come from its creator, contributors, and the broader JavaScript community. Though these guidelines are not strict rules, they can offer valuable inspiration for software design.

### Small Core

The Node.js core is designed with a minimal set of functionalities, relying on the broader ecosystem of external modules (userland) for additional features. This approach promotes faster experimentation and iteration outside the core, fostering a dynamic community and a more maintainable, stable core. This minimalism positively influences the evolution of the entire Node.js ecosystem.
### Small Modules

Node.js structures code using modules, emphasizing small, focused modules with a narrow scope. This principle, rooted in the Unix philosophy of "small is beautiful" and "do one thing well," encourages high reusability and simplicity. Node.js, with tools like npm and yarn, solves dependency conflicts by allowing packages to use their own versions of dependencies. This approach enables the use of numerous small modules, even ones with just a few lines of code. Small modules are easier to understand, test, maintain, and are ideal for browser use, applying the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to an extreme level.
